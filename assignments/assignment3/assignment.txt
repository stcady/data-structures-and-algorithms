Question ONE:
Describe Insertion Sort algorithm, Provide a implementation in language of your choice to sort an array of upper case alphabets.
    The Insertion Sort algorithm works by using a set of nested loops. The outer loop is used to pick each value incrementally in the array and save is as a temporary variable.
The inner loop is used to iterate through subsequent subarray and compare the current value with the previous values. The elements in the array are shifted to the right until
the comparison no longer holds true. The inner loop is then exited and the saved insertion value is inserted into the proper position. This process is repeted until the outer
loop has iterated through all elements in the array. The insertion sort algorithm is not a very efficient algorithm when it comes to time complexity, but it is quite efficient in space complexity as it only needs to store
the current element to be inserted. The algorithms worst case runtime complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(1).

Question TWO:
Describe the data structure HashMap.  You are free to use language of your choice to demo a HashMap. Feel free to use API if needed. 

Question THREE:
Describe the data structure Deque. No implementation required.
